# Torch Take-Home Exercise

## Overview

This exercise is designed to take **2–3 hours**. We are not looking for a perfect solution — we are looking for how you think, the decisions you make, and how you approach building something that could realistically go to production.

Use AI tools — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, whatever you prefer. We expect you to use them. A working solution produced with AI assistance in two hours is not impressive on its own. What we are looking for is the judgment you applied on top of it: what you changed, what you rejected, and why.

Simple and clear beats complex and clever. If you are spending time gold-plating, stop.

## How we assess

We grade judgment, not completeness. A submission where every part is finished but none of it shows a clear point of view is weaker than one where half the parts are done but the decisions are well-reasoned and owned.

We are specifically looking for:
- Whether you understood the problem before you started building
- Whether your agent reasons or just calls everything unconditionally
- Whether your output would actually be useful to a non-technical reviewer
- Whether you can define what "correct" means for an AI system, not just implement it
- Whether you know when to defer to a human

Using an AI tool to fill in stubs without thinking is visible. Using it to move faster while you focus on the hard decisions is exactly what we want to see.

## Context

You are joining Torch as the first AI/ML engineer. One of the first things we want to build is a system that helps reviewers assess incoming records more quickly and confidently.

When a new record comes in, a reviewer needs to answer two questions:

1. Is this record likely to result in a loss — i.e. will costs exceed the revenue it generates?
2. What do similar historical records tell us about this one?

Your task is to build a prototype system that helps answer both questions — not as two separate queries, but as an agent that reasons over the record and produces a single, useful recommendation.

**A note on the target variable:** `is_loss_making` is `True` when the actual losses on a record exceeded the premium charged (i.e. `loss_ratio > 1.0`). Your model should predict this outcome before we know the result.

---

## The Task

### Part 1 — Loss Prediction (in the notebook)

Open `notebooks/modelling.ipynb`. Using `records.csv`, build a model that predicts whether a new record is likely to result in a loss. Save your trained model artifact to `app/artifacts/` so the app can load it.

**We care about:**
- How you explore and understand the data before modelling
- Why you chose the model you did
- How you would think about explainability — a reviewer needs to understand why a record is flagged
- What the limitations of your model are

### Part 2 — Assessment Agent (in the app)

Implement the agent logic in `app/tools.py` and `app/model.py`. The retrieval tool (`retrieve_similar_records`) is already wired up — focus on the model prediction tool and the agent's reasoning.

The agent has two tools available: the loss prediction model and the document retrieval system. It should reason over the record and decide how to use them — not call everything blindly.

The agent should produce a recommendation for the reviewer that draws on both tools where appropriate. It should know when it has enough information to make a recommendation, and when it does not.

**We care about:**
- How the agent decides what to do — is it reasoning or just calling everything unconditionally?
- What guardrails you put in place — termination conditions, fallbacks
- How it handles uncertainty — low model confidence, poor retrieval results
- Whether the output is genuinely useful to a non-technical reviewer
- Cost awareness — each LLM call has a cost. We expect the first AI/ML hire to own the AI budget. Where are the cost risks in your agent design, and what did you do about them?

### Part 2b — Agent Evaluation (in evals/)

Implement `score_recommendation()` in `evals/eval.py` and run the harness against `evals/eval_set.json` — 20 records with known outcomes.

**We care about:**
- How you define "correct" for a free-text recommendation — this is not obvious
- Whether your eval catches failure modes the agent might hide behind confident-sounding language
- How you would use this eval to improve the agent over time

### Part 3 — Response Contract (in the app)

The agent loop is already wired to the `/assess` endpoint. Your job is to design `AssessResponse` in `app/schemas.py`.

What fields does a non-technical reviewer actually need to see? What would make this response useful — or useless — in practice? Justify your design in `APPROACH.md`.

**We care about:**
- Whether the response communicates uncertainty in a way a reviewer can act on
- Whether it tells the reviewer when to seek a second opinion
- Whether it would be useful to an auditor six months later

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Add your API key

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and replace `your-api-key-here` with the key provided separately.

### 3. Verify the data is present

```
data/
├── records.csv       # Historical records with loss outcomes (note: contains data quality issues to handle)
├── documents/        # Plain-English summaries, one per record
└── new_record.json   # The record to assess
```

---

## Running the app

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

- `GET  /health` — liveness check
- `POST /assess` — run the assessment agent on a new record

Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

To test the assess endpoint with the provided example record:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/assess \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"record\": $(cat data/new_record.json)}"
```

---

## Running the notebook

```bash
uv run jupyter notebook notebooks/modelling.ipynb
```

Or open it directly in VS Code / Cursor.

## What to submit

A GitHub repo (public or private — if private, please invite us) containing:

- Your completed notebook (`notebooks/modelling.ipynb`)
- Your completed app logic (`app/tools.py`, `app/model.py`, `app/main.py`)
- Your completed eval harness (`evals/eval.py`) with results
- Your saved model artifact (`app/artifacts/model.pkl`)
- A short `APPROACH.md` (one page maximum) covering:
  - The decisions you made and why — not a list of what you built, but why you made the specific choices you did
  - What you would do differently with more time
  - Where your AI tool made a suggestion you changed, rejected, or overrode — and why. What did you decide that it could not decide for you?
  - How would you know if the model was degrading in production? What signals would tell you the training data is no longer representative of what you are seeing?
  - How would you design a feedback loop so that reviewer decisions flow back into the model — not just as labels, but as a way to catch where the system is systematically wrong?
  - What would you need in place before putting this into production — covering cost, latency, monitoring, and the conditions under which the system should stop making recommendations and defer to a human

## What we are not looking for

- A perfect model or state-of-the-art retrieval
- Changes to the plumbing we have provided — focus on the logic
- A large codebase — simple and clear beats complex and clever
