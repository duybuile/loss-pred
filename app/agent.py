"""
Assessment agent — pre-wired loop that drives the LLM through tool calls.

The mechanics here are provided. The things left for you to decide:

    MAX_ITERATIONS  — how many tool-call rounds should the agent be allowed?
                      Think about cost, latency, and what happens if you set
                      this too high or too low.

    SYSTEM_PROMPT   — instructs the agent on its role, its tools, and what a
                      good recommendation looks like. The quality of this prompt
                      directly affects the quality of the output.

# TODO — set a sensible limit. Consider: what are the cost and latency implications

# TODO — write the system prompt. The agent needs to know:
#   - what it is and who it's helping
#   - what each tool does and when to use it (vs when not to)
#   - what a useful recommendation looks like to a non-technical reviewer
#   - how to handle uncertainty (low confidence, poor retrieval, ambiguous record)
# Justify the key choices in your prompt in APPROACH.md. What did you instruct the
# agent to do that it would not have done by default? What did you explicitly rule out?

    Run the assessment agent on a single record.
